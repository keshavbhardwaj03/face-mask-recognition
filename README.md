Project Overview:

Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a machine learning project that aims to detect whether individuals are wearing masks or not from real-time video streams. The project leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify individuals into two categories: "masked" and "unmasked."

Dataset and Model:

The model was trained on a meticulously curated dataset comprising over 5000 images, split into two categories: "masked" and "unmasked." We utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train the model, a powerful architecture well-suited for image classification tasks. With rigorous training, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 95%, demonstrating its efficacy in distinguishing between masked and unmasked faces.

Real-Time Detection:

In real-world scenarios, we often encounter individuals in various settings where wearing masks is essential for safety and health. To address this, we integrated the trained model with a live video stream from a laptop camera. The application accurately detects and labels individuals as "masked" or "unmasked" in real-time, providing an efficient solution for monitoring mask-wearing compliance.

How to Use:

To utilize the Face Mask Detection system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the README file.
Run the main script to initiate the real-time face mask detection using your laptop's camera.
Observe the output, where individuals in the video stream will be marked as "masked" or "unmasked" in real-time.
